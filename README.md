Given a set of upstream DNA sequences from genes of the Agrobacterium tumefaciens C58 genome that are known to be regulated by the same transcription- factor (TF) protein. Its algorithm's goal is to find the TF binding site motif in the upstream region of these genes and then use this motif to find all other genes in the genome that are also bound by the same transcription factor. After finding this set of genes that are co-regulated, it should identify a possible purpose for this family of genes.
